Symfony/Marvel Example Application
========================

## Installation
`$ yarn install`


## Development
`$ yarn start/stop`


## Debugging
### Access running container
`$ yarn bash`


### Managing JS & SCSS
The Symfony Encore library provides a wrapper for webpack transpilation and compilation to the /web/build directory. Any changes made in /assets/js and /assets/css will be automatically recompiled and live reloaded for you.

If additional entry points are required, these may be added in webpack.config.js.
